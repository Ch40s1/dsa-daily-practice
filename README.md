I need a way to study data structures and algorithms. This project will be a study site. It will have questions to help study.
For now it gives a question you have to conplete and then it compares the file given to the answer file.

## Usage
Clone repo or download file
Run ``` python src/main.py or python3 src/main.py ```

### Future plans
Make it into a website for studying
