# dsa-daily-practice 

my goal is to make a daily data structures and algorithm reminder. When you launch the terminal it asks if you want a dsa question. Answering it right earns points and depending on the points you have it create a harder or easier question.

## Usage
when first version releases It will post usage notes.

## Status
