I need a way to study data structures and algorithms. This project will be a study site. It will have questions to help study.
It uses django and will soon be up and running.

## Usage
Clone repo or download file
Run ``` python src/main.py or python3 src/main.py ```

### Future plans 
Make it into a website for studying
